# pretty printed output to the input file name.
#
# Set Debug to 1 to not rename the input file and send the output to the
# console rather than write it to the file, but no other debug messages.

# Set Debug to 2 for debug messages on entry and exit from subroutines and
# to not rename the input file iand write the output to the console rather
# than the file for debugging.

# Set Debug to 3 for very verbose debug messages.
